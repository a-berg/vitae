experience:
- jobtitle: Data Scientist
  location: Vigo, Pontevedra
  company: Gradiant
  start: '2021'
  end: now
  highlights:
  - Solved ML problems with time series and tabular data, using Deep Learning, Gradient
    Boosting, or Reinforcement Learning (among others).
  - Performed extensive data analysis in Python.
  - Experienced in MLOps and ML Engineering, such as experiment tracking, model deployment
    and versioning. I also was an early member of the then-emerging AI&Data Ops team.
  - Work with cloud technologies, particularly Kubernetes, Airflow and Spark.
  - Recently, had the opportunity to manage a team of three developers in a project
    management role.
  - Mentored junior data scientists at my company, emphasizing software design principles
    and effective use of ML and MLOps tools.
  - Organized and led coding-dojos on diverse topics such as an introduction to pola.rs,
    Julia, or functional programming techniques in Python.
  - Delivered a guest lecture to third-year Artificial Intelligence BSc students at
    the University of Santiago de Compostela, providing an introduction to industry
    applications in Industry 4.0.
  duration: 3 years & 3 months
- jobtitle: Research Technician
  location: Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña
  company: Centro Singular de Investigación en Tecnoloxías Intelixentes
  start: '2019'
  end: '2021'
  highlights:
  - Utilized neural networks (with Keras and Tensorflow) to model industrial processes
    as a mid-level developer.
  - Participated in the implementation of prescriptive analytics to control and automate
    the one part of the process.
  - Experience in mentoring junior team members, uploading and maintaining models
    in client's machines and Hyperparameter tuning with a HPC cluster.
  - Proficient in various neural network architectures and feature selection algorithms.
  duration: 1 year & 9 months
- jobtitle: ADAS Technician
  location: O Porriño, Pontevedra
  company: Centro Tecnológico de Automoción de Galicia
  start: '2018'
  end: '2019'
  highlights:
  - Developed custom LiDAR point cloud segmentation algorithm.
  - Successfully improved sensor performance.
  - Entry-level knowledge in multi-object tracking and sensor fusion using Kalman
    filters.
  - Gained junior-level \Cpp programming expertise in the context of 3D Computer Vision
    algorithms.
  duration: 1 year & 2 months
- jobtitle: Junior Researcher
  location: Zaragoza
  company: Universidad de Zaragoza
  start: '2015'
  end: '2016'
  highlights:
  - Implemented an algorithm in Matlab using dimensionality reduction techniques for
    a thermal-mechanical problem in a novel research setting as a junior.
  - The implemented solution was orders of magnitude faster than commercial software.
  - Worked under the guidance of mentors.
  - Gained strong skills in Matlab, and understanding of how dimensionality reduction
    techniques can be applied to an industrial setting.
